Issue: AsyncStorage and React Native Async Storage Version Mismatch
1) When I'm implementing data storage using AsyncStorage, there was an error related to version mismatch between the AsyncStorage package used in the code and the React Native version.
Solution: The issue was resolved by ensuring that the @react-native-async-storage/async-storage package was correctly installed and compatible with the React Native version.

Issue: Platform-Specific Styling
2)The requirement was to apply different margins based on the platform (iOS and Android).
Challenge: Achieving platform-specific styling required conditionally applying styles based on the platform.
Solution: The Platform module from React Native was used to apply different margins for Android and iOS. The appropriate margin values were added to styles using platform-specific conditions.

Issue: Generating Standalone APK with Expo
3)While generating a standalone APK using Expo, there were challenges in configuring build settings and handling the build process.
Challenge: Understanding the Expo build configuration and providing necessary information (e.g., keystore, release/debug settings) for generating the APK.
Solution: The official Expo documentation was thoroughly followed to correctly configure build settings and handle the APK generation process. This included selecting build type (debug/release), specifying keystore information, and addressing any build errors encountered.

Issue: Image Zooming Implementation
4)Implementing image zooming using the PinchGestureHandler posed challenges in handling the gesture events and scaling images.
Challenge: Understanding the PinchGestureHandler component and managing the scaling of images in response to pinch gestures.
Solution: The official documentation for the react-native-gesture-handler library was referred to for guidance on using PinchGestureHandler. The implementation involved handling gesture events and updating image scaling accordingly.
Conclusion and Overcoming Challenges

Issue: Testing Configuration
5) react-test-renderer is required to set as per the same react version available
solution: checked version and downloaded specific version of react-test-renderer.
